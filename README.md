## A Comparison and Analysis of Consumer Price Index in Countries with Contrasting Government and Economic Structures
This repo holds a time series analysis project I had completed in college where I explore my interests in international relations, economics, and public policy through an analytical, data focused lens.

#### Executive Summary

The fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has provided insight on the health of the
economy and the impact of government decisions on consumer purchasing power and demand. With the
impact of many current events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian War, rising
inflation costs were evident across the world. However, when looking at different countries and their
financial policies, how were some countries able to survive and recover from these financial disasters
faster compared to others? This led to the question of how different government systems and degrees of
power over the economy can influence the reaction and speed at which a country can recover from a
financial crisis.

When analyzing government control over certain countries and their influence on their respective
economies, we could see that there were two main categories of control that we could filter many nations
into: free market economies and controlled economies. Free market economies included countries such as
the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and more. On the other hand, countries that had more
controlled economics included China, Russia, North Korea, and more. Many would argue that free market
economies, by default, are superior to command economies due to its values of financial freedom and
independence. By comparing the differences in CPI, we can see in what ways increased financial planning
excels at and where free market economies fall short...

#### Data Sources
For this analysis, I selected monthly CPI data from the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and
Russia. The data taken from FRED is sourced from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, who reports the CPI data following the ‘CPI release calendar of respective country’. The units of the data set are Indexes on a scale of 1 to 100, relative to the recent recession in April 2020. By setting all the data sets to these parameters, we can easily compare the different countries without much worry about currency exchange rates and reporting methods for the financial data.

Additionally, this data has yet to be seasonalized, so the trends and patterns that we see are representative
of the original data.
